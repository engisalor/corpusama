The Palestinian Centre for human rights
(PCHR) is appealing to the Ministries of Health in the Ramallah and Gaza
Governments to take all possible measures to facilitate referrals for Gazan
patients who need urgent medical treatment outside Gaza.
The Centre is alarmed at the deterioration
of patient's health following two key political decisions on healthcare
provision. In January 2009, the Ramallah Ministry of Health (MOH) cancelled
financial coverage for all Palestinian patients in Israeli hospitals, including
those who in the middle of long term treatment.
On 22 March, the Gaza Ministry of Health
subsequently took over the Department of External Medical Treatment in
Gaza. The Ministry of Health dismissed the department Director, Dr. Bassam
al-Badri, who was appointed by the Government in Ramallah with the prior
approval of the Gaza Government. This means that all coordination procedures
required to facilitate Gazapatient's access to Palestinian hospitals in
the West Bankvia Erez Crossing have now been suspended. This crisis has
been exacerbated by the continued closure of Rafah Crossing. Patients in
Gazanow have no access to medical treatment outside of Gaza.
In light of the continuing siege and
closure of the Gaza Strip, including Rafah International Crossing Point,
the lives of hundreds of Gazapatients are now at risk.
PCHR is following developments, including
monitoring the health of hundreds of patients in the Gaza Strip who require
urgent medical treatment that remains unavailable in Gazahospitals. According
to information made available to PCHR, the health of many of these patients
is deteriorating. PCHR has been made aware of a number of cases of patients
who were admitted to Gaza hospitals after being denied access to treatment
abroad. Relatives of these patients are now visiting the PCHR Legal Unit
on a daily basis, asking the Centre to intervene immediately.
PCHR holds the governments in Ramallah
and in Gaza fully responsible for the consequences that their actions may
have on the lives of Gazapatients. The Centre appeals to both parties to
act on their legal and moral responsibilities to save the lives of these
patients, including civilians who sustained injuries during the recent
Israeli military offensive in Gaza. These men, women and children are being
denied urgent medical treatment to which they are entitled.
PCHR calls upon:
- The Ramallah Ministry of Health to
immediately reinstate financial coverage for the hundreds of Palestinian
patients who need to complete life-saving treatment in Israeli hospitals,
including chemotherapy and radiotherapy. These include 57 children who
need to complete ongoing treatment in Hadassah Hospitalin Jerusalem. Suspending
medical referrals in the context of the ongoing siege of Gazais putting
these patients' lives at risk, and the Government in Ramallah must accept
responsibility for this situation.
- The Ministry of Health (MOH) in Gaza
Government to reverse its take over of the Department of External Medical
Treatment. The Gaza MOH must allow the Director and his staff to return
to work immediately, in order for them to advocate for hundreds of patients
who need urgent medical treatment abroad.
- The Israeli authorities to fulfill
their obligations, as an Occupying Power, with respect to the care and
protection of the Palestinian population in the Occupied Palestinian Territory
(OPT) as codified in, inter alia, the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949,
and the two Additional Protocols of 1977.

On Tuesday 24 March 2009, the Chief of
General Staff of the Israeli Army ruled to release five detainees being
held as 'unlawful combatants': Sameer Hamouda Saleh Hamada, 40; Saleh Mohammed
Saleh Hamada, 33; Mohammed Anwar Hamouda Hamada, 35; Hasan Ali Nasar Abu
Hlaiyl, 48; and Sameer Ali Mohammed Al-Atar, 38. They are from Beit Lahiya
town and were arrested by the Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF) from their
area of residence over which the IOF took control during its 23 day invasion
of 27 December 2008 - 18 January 2009.
The Israeli authorities announced that
a number of detained Palestinians had been transferred to the Beer el-Sabe
(Beer Sheva) District Court to confirm their status as 'unlawful combatants'
under a special law, "The Unlawful Combatants Law" (5762-2002).
On the basis of this law the Beerel-Sabe District Court ruled that the
detainees were "unlawful combatants" after the army claimed that
it had confidential files and confidential intelligence information about
what it described as their 'activities against the security of Israel'
and 'membership in hostile organizations.'
According to The Unlawful Combatants
Law, the Israeli Chief of Staff may submit a request to the Beer el-Sabe
District Court to categorize any Gaza Strip resident as an 'unlawful combatant'
on the basis of confidential evidence and Israeli intelligence reports.
The continued detention of these detainees does not require an admission
of guilt or the existence of evidence acceptable as part of fair trial
standards. This law essentially licenses the military to hold individuals
arbitrarily and indefinitely, on the basis of assumed rather than proven
guilt that they are conducting direct or indirect activities that could
harm the security of Israel or are affiliated to groups working to harm
the security of Israel. The law as applied to Palestinian citizens who
are residents of Gaza has retroactive force.
Israel passed this law for political
considerations. The Israeli government sought to ensure its ability to
detain Gaza's residents for long periods of time without a trial meeting
bare minimum fair trial standards in a flagrant violation of the rules
of international humanitarian law, customary international law and international
human rights law applicable to the Gaza Strip.
The law removes the need that an 'individual
protected person is definitely suspected of, or engaged in, activities
hostile to the security of the State' required by Article 5 of the Fourth
Geneva Convention. The Fourth Geneva Convention stresses also the right
to a fair trial. The Unlawful Combatants Law therefore constitutes a grave
violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention, especially as the law also enables
indefinite detention without specific charges. The law also constitutes
a violation of Article 50, paragraph 1 of Additional Protocol I to the
Geneva Conventions which is considered customary international law. This
article states: "In case of doubt whether a person is a civilian,
that person shall be considered to be a civilian." Israeli practice
is the opposite, as the categorization as unlawful combatants of Gaza residents
is made on the basis of assumption.
The Israeli law also violates the basic
principles of international law that prohibit the passing of a law with
retroactive effect. The Unlawful Combatants Law was applied retroactively
to people being held on the date of the commencement of the law. The retroactivity
contravenes international humanitarian law and the fundamental principles
of international law; non-retroactivity is enshrined the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights Article 11 and Article 15 of the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights.
The decision to release the five abovementioned
detainees confirms previous assertions by Al Mezan Center for Human Rights
that the categorization of Gazan detainees as 'unlawful combatants' is
an arbitrary practice, based not on evidence, but on the inability of the
IOF to present any charges against the detainees.
Al Mezan Center for Human Rights considers
the continued and indeed increasing categorization of Palestinians resident
in Gaza as 'unlawful combatants' as yet further evidence of the nature
of the Israeli judiciary which provides legal cover to the grave human
rights violations perpetrated by the IOF in the oPt.
Al Mezan calls on the international
community to:
- Immediately intervene to provide protection
to Palestinian detainees
- Press for the repeal of the 'Unlawful
Combatants Law'
- Assume its legal obligation towards
Palestinian civilians subject to grave and systematic human rights violations,
especially detainees.
